Last update November 25th 2023

## Before starting

Clear any existing save file by pressing Up + B + Select on the game title screen

Hard Reset (set palette with Up + B - optional to give full visibility in Rock Tunnel), hard resetting is required before each attempt on emulator

Set your options to fast text and animations OFF

## **Nidoran Split** Let's begin!

Name yourself and rival “A” or any one character.

***Get Item*** ***POTION*** Pick up the PC Potion.

***Get Pokemon*** *#Squirtle:5* Pick Squirtle
> Name Squirtle one character.\
> Naming Squirtle “B” can help avoid confusion later when checking stats on Brock and teaching moves throughout the run, assuming you plan to name Nidoran “A”

***Battle*** ***Rival 1 - Bulbasaur*** **Rival 1** Tail Whip + spam Tackle
> Tail Whip turn 2 if growled turn 1. This is slower on average but has a higher win rate\
> Optional: check stats on level up after Rival 1\
> 11 SPC is likely bad special (3 hit on Geodude and/or Onix)\
> 12 SPC is guaranteed good special (2 hit on Geodude & Onix)

***Encounter*** *Rattata:2* Route 1: Spam Tackle to faint one encounter that is L2 or L3
> This early EXP will get Bubble for Brock

***Shop*** Viridian Mart: Buy 8 Poke Balls
- 8 POKE_BALL

Walk west to the grass patch on Route 22.

Optional - Save the game before searching for Nidoran.

Catch a L3 or L4 Nidoran♂ and give it a one-character name
> L3 Nido: Tackle once before throwing Poke Balls
>
> L4 Nido: just throw Poke Balls
>
> L5 Spearow: just throw Poke Balls, since it outspeeds us

Next are tables you can use if you are familiar with DSUM. For your first runs you can just search randomly in the grass until you get a Nido.
