Route: Red Any Glitchless (Classic) [Beginner Route]
	S: Before starting
		Clear any existing save file by pressing Up + B + Select on the game title screen
		Hard Reset (set palette with Up + B - optional to give full visibility in Rock Tunnel), hard resetting is required before each attempt on emulator
		Set your options to fast text and animations OFF
	S: Nidoran Split :: Let's begin!
		Name yourself and rival “A” or any one character.
		GetI: POTION :: Pick up the PC Potion.
		GetP: Squirtle:5
			Name Squirtle one character.
			Naming Squirtle “B” can help avoid confusion later when checking stats on Brock and teaching moves throughout the run, assuming you plan to name Nidoran “A”
		B: Rival 1 - Bulbasaur :: Rival 1 :: Tail Whip + spam Tackle
			Tail Whip turn 2 if growled turn 1. This is slower on average but has a higher win rate
			Optional: check stats on level up after Rival 1
			11 SPC is likely bad special (3 hit on Geodude and/or Onix)
			12 SPC is guaranteed good special (2 hit on Geodude & Onix)
		E: RATTATA:2 :: Route 1: Spam Tackle to faint one encounter that is L2 or L3
			This early EXP will get Bubble for Brock

		// When walking down to deliver Oak's Parcel, cut through the second-to-last patch of grass if you haven't yet fought an encounter
		// S: Pallet Town
			// When delivering the Parcel, walk behind or next to Prof. Oak so that your (slow walking) rival takes fewer steps in the cutscene

		Shop: Viridian Mart: Buy 8 Poke Balls
			8 POKE_BALL
		Walk west to the grass patch on Route 22.
		Optional - Save the game before searching for Nidoran.
		Catch a L3 or L4 Nidoran♂ and give it a one-character name
			L3 Nido: Tackle once before throwing Poke Balls
			L4 Nido: just throw Poke Balls
			L5 Spearow: just throw Poke Balls, since it outspeeds us
		Next are tables you can use if you are familiar with DSUM. For your first runs you can just search randomly in the grass until you get a Nido.
