	S: Mt. Moon
		As soon as you enter Mt. Moon, save and hard reset
		RNG manipulate a Paras encounter by replicating the inputs in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zITeWzAheto
			This manip has a 4/60 chance to produce a bad early encounter (meaning you won't get the Paras)
			The manip has a 1/60 chance to produce an early Paras (you should weaken this one, since you won't get the normal one)
			The manip has a 1/60 chance to produce a Paras on the desired tile that does not get in the ball with perfectly executed inputs
			If the Paras breaks out, or you're not confident in throwing the ball perfectly, Poison Sting it once before throwing a ball
			This manip requires a lot of practice. You can do runs without it while learning, but you'll eventually want to attempt it
			If the manip fails, it might have been due to RNG. You can either continue as normal and perform a backup Paras manip at the end of Mt. Moon, or re-save to get a new chance
