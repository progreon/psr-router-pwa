		RNG manipulate a Paras encounter by replicating the inputs in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zITeWzAheto

			The manip has a 1/60 chance to produce a Paras on the desired tile that does not get in the ball with perfectly executed inputs
			If the Paras breaks out, or you're not confident in throwing the ball perfectly, Poison Sting it once before throwing a ball
			This manip requires a lot of practice. You can do runs without it while learning, but you'll eventually want to attempt it
